        <h2>Why I chose USC</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>
                I chose USC because it was only about an hour and a half from home. USC gave me more money than
                Clemson and other schools I was considering. I also heard that USC was academically a good school.

        <h2>Transition</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>
                Transitioning to USC was pretty tough at first. It was strange being away from home.
                It was a completely new experience. Some of my first thoughts were of self-doubt. 
                I struggled with the work load at first. It was so different from high school.Especially
                with my Algorithmic Design class.

        <div class="about">
            <p>
                However, the transition was not terrible. I have many favorite memories here. I remember
                meeting my roommates for the first time.
                I remember staying up really late one night playing videogames with them. 
                I remember getting my first math test back and it was actually a 
                decent grade.

        <h2>Academic Transition</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>
                The difference between classes from high school and college made me struggle at first.
                I procrastinated a lot, I did not study for awhile, and it caused me a lot of stress.
                Combine that with the immense workload of college, and I was pretty stressed out 
                at first. To make the transition, I just had to stop procrastinating and start studying.
                As soon as I did that, I noticed a huge change in how stressed I was. The TI's in my 
                classes also helped a lot, as I was able to ask them questions. Another USC resource I used 
                was the Career Center. One assignment for a class was to make a resume, and the Career Center
                reviewed it and gave me feedback before I turned it in.

        <h2>Favorite Part of Being at USC</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>
                My favorite part of being a student at USC has been all the people I have met.
                I have become pretty close with my roommates.

        <h2>Next Semester</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>
                I have learned a lot about myself this semester. I have learned that 
                I can hangle the workload and stress of college. I have learned that I 
                can balance getting good grades and having a social life. With this information, I will 
                go into next semester more confident than I was going into this semester. I will also try
                to step out of my comfort zone more next semester, now that I have handled the transition
                of moving to college. If I could give one piece of advice to incoming freshmen, it would be to 
                stay on top of assignments and not procrastinate.
