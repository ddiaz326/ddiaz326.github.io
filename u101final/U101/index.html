            Hello! I am Dylan Diaz and I study computer science. I am from Boiling Springs, South Carolina. When I graduate and gain experience, I would love to eventually work for NASA! I want to help code rovers and other technology that will expand humanity's knowledge of the universe.

        <h2>Why I chose USC</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>
                I chose USC because it was only about an hour and a half from home. USC gave me more money than
                Clemson and other schools I was considering. I also heard that USC was academically a good school.
            </p>

        <h2>Transition</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>
                Transitioning to USC was pretty tough at first. It was strange being away from home.
                It was a completely new experience. Some of my first thoughts were of self-doubt. 
                I struggled with the work load at first. It was so different from high school.Especially
                with my Algorithmic Design class.

            <p>
                However, the transition was not terrible. I have many favorite memories here. I remember
                meeting my roommates for the first time.
                I remember staying up really late one night playing videogames with them. 
                I remember getting my first math test back and it was actually a 
                decent grade.

                <p>The Affinity Diagram is a diagram of all the possible problems, opportunities, and steps I may face when implementing my app. It consists of all my thoughts about starting this project. I have learned that creating this app will be more challenging than I thought, and that there are many steps I will have to take that I did not consider beforehand. I am more aware of the amount of work it requires to take on a task this large.</p>
