                <p>The Affinity Diagram (you may have to scroll to the right to see all of the image) is a diagram of all the possible problems, opportunities, and steps I may face when implementing my app. It consists of all my thoughts about starting this project. I have learned that creating this app will be more challenging than I thought, and that there are many steps I will have to take that I did not consider beforehand. I am more aware of the amount of work it requires to take on a task this large.</p>
